          <h2> What is Minecraft</h2> 
           
       <p>Minecraft is a sandbox construction game created by Mojang AB founder Markus "Notch" Persson, inspired by Infiniminer,
           Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and Notch's past games Legend of the Chambered and RubyDung. Gameplay involves players 
       interacting with the game world by placing and breaking various types of blocks in a three-dimensional environment. In this 
       environment, players can build creative structures, creations, and artwork on multiplayer servers and singleplayer worlds
       across multiple game modes.</p>

           <p>Minecraft: Java Edition is available for NZ $40.16 (€23.95, US$26.95, £17.95). When purchased, singleplayer and multiplayer game 
       modes can be played using the downloadable stand-alone launcher. The official demo is free, but has a time limit. Minecraft 
       development started around May 10, 2009, and pre-orders for the full game were accepted starting from June 13, 2009
       . Minecraft's official release date was November 18, 2011. As of July 4, 2018, Java Edition is the second best-selling
       PC game of all time and has reached 30 million sales as of April 3, 2019.</p>

       <p> Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by Swedish game developer Markus Persson and released by Mojang in 
           2011. The game allows players to build with a variety of different blocks in a 3D procedurally generated 
           world, requiring creativity from players. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, 
           crafting, and combat. Multiple game modes that change gameplay are available, including—but not limited to—a survival
           mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players
           have unlimited resources to build with.</p>
           
           
           <p>The Java Edition of the game allows players to modify the game with mods
           to create new gameplay mechanics, items, textures and assets. In September 2014, Microsoft announced a deal to
           buy Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property for US$2.5 billion, with the acquisition completed two months later.</p>
